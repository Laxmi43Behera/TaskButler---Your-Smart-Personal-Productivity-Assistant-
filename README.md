# TaskButler-Your Smart Personal Productivity Assistant
TaskButler is a Python-based command-line task manager that combines smart automation with witty motivation to boost your productivity. Designed for those who find traditional to-do lists uninspiring, it uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze your tasks, automatically scoring them based on urgency and keywords like "ASAP" or "important."  

Beyond basic task tracking, TaskButler offers data-driven insights through visual charts (powered by Matplotlib and Seaborn) to help you understand your workload distribution. Its "Roast Mode" delivers playful, sarcastic feedback to keep you accountable, while features like deadline reminders, CSV exports, and auto-generated summaries ensure you stay organized.  

Built with Python’s NLTK for text processing and Pandas for task management, TaskButler is lightweight, fast, and entirely CLI-based—no bloated GUIs. Whether you need tough love or just a smarter way to prioritize, TaskButler turns task management into an engaging, efficient experience.
